# HackerRank

Starting my HackerRank Journey

- Completed a lot of Online Assessments using HackerRank. Might as well start practising here on top of LeetCode.
- Exploring a ton of languages, starting with Golang, Rust, and Scala. (Golang and Rust just because concurrency, its interesting, and popularity. Scala because I am interested in functional programming)
